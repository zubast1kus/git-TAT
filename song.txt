Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world, what does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', "Baby, what you gonnaâ€”?"
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

She's a lover, baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen her comin' when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah
